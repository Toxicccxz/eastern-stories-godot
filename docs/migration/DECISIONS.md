# Migration Decisions

## Condition update order

**Decision:** A single native condition update uses a snapshot of active condition IDs sorted by stable ID string in ascending order.

**Reason:** `feature/condition.c` obtains `keys(conditions)` from an LPC mapping and iterates that array backwards. The mudlib does not define mapping key order as gameplay data, yet multiple conditions can mutate the same resource and therefore need a deterministic native order. Stable ID order is independent of insertion order, hash layout, and save/restore behavior.

**Compatibility impact:** Multiple simultaneous conditions may resolve in a different order from a particular MudOS/FluffOS process. Individual condition formulas, flag aggregation, snapshot behavior, and post-update removal semantics remain unchanged. Source: `reference/es2/mudlib/feature/condition.c`.

## Cultivation percentage division by zero

**Decision:** If a Phase 3B1 health-percentage check reaches a primary resource whose maximum is zero, return a typed `LEGACY_ZERO_MAXIMUM_*_DIVISOR` failure at that exact validation position, without mutation.

**Reason:** `exercise.c`, `meditate.c`, and `respirate.c` calculate `current * 100 / maximum` without guarding zero. The LPC command therefore aborts with a driver division error rather than producing a gameplay failure string. A pure domain transition must not crash the application, and treating zero as merely “below 70%” would hide the source defect and alter validation evidence.

**Compatibility impact:** The native call returns a diagnosable failure instead of throwing a MudOS/FluffOS runtime error. It preserves validation order and the absence of mutation. No positive minimum is imposed on internal-resource current or maximum values. Sources: `reference/es2/mudlib/cmds/std/exercise.c`, `meditate.c`, `respirate.c`.

## Self-learning with non-positive intelligence

**Decision:** Phase 3B2 rejects `selflearn` with a typed `LEGACY_NON_POSITIVE_INTELLIGENCE` failure when base `int` is zero or negative, without mutation.

**Reason:** `selflearn.c` computes `300 / int` without a zero guard. Zero aborts immediately. Negative intelligence produces a negative gin cost and later passes it to `receive_damage()`, which raises an error for negative damage; the LPC path may already have modified potential/skill progress before that error. A native domain transition must not crash or leave a partially applied transaction.

**Compatibility impact:** Normal positive-intelligence behavior is unchanged. Invalid legacy states receive a deterministic typed failure instead of a driver error or partial mutation. This is not a new gameplay minimum for valid characters. Sources: `reference/es2/mudlib/cmds/std/selflearn.c`, `feature/damage.c`.
