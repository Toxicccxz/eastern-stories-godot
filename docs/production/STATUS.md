# Productionization Status

## Current milestone

Phase 10C1's shared application shell is implementation-complete and locally audited on
`phase/10c1-cross-platform-game-shell`, ready for its final PR. It builds on the integrated Phase 10B
native Save/Load foundation and Phase 10A repository/build/CI foundation. Phase 10C1 is **not yet
integrated into main**: final PR, four green PR jobs, authorized merge, and green post-merge main CI
are still required. Phase 10C2 has not started. This is not game completion or store readiness.

Completed local shell capabilities are Main Menu, explicit New Game/Continue, Pause/Resume and Save,
explicit backup/temp recovery, confirmed Return to Menu, and independent Settings with desktop
Windowed/Fullscreen. Shared keyboard/mouse/controller semantic navigation has desktop runtime proof;
this does not claim physical controller or mobile-device qualification. See the
[Application Shell contract](contracts/APPLICATION_SHELL_CONTRACT.md) and
[final integration audit](../migration/PHASE_10C1_FINAL_AUDIT.md).

Formally closed gameplay foundations include:

- typed character attributes/resources, recovery, conditions, and lifecycle thresholds;
- Skill Core, cultivation, Practice, Selflearn, Learn, and authored progression effects/policies;
- item identity, containment, stacks/currency, inventory transfer, equipment, and armor;
- native item save DTO/validation foundation, item destruction, death/corpse, loot, and legacy
  autoload import boundary;
- ordinary combat math, attack resolution, force policy, progression/busy completion,
  relationships, reciprocal attack composition, and the first playable combat slice;
- NPC/world/spawn typed foundations and authored Old Pine bandits/loadouts;
- one resident Old Pine Session with Outdoor/Cave map lifetime;
- Vine traversal, Passage Cave/SouthExit roundtrip, Waterfall, River, Cliff, and source-faithful
  one-way Pine route;
- typed native Save snapshots/JSON/repository, exact item and RNG continuation, fresh world/NPC/corpse
  reconstruction, restart-stable Save eligibility, transactional Session replacement, and fresh-process
  Outdoor/Cave restore proof.

The current canonical main scene is
`res://scenes/application/application_shell.tscn`. It owns one persistent Runtime Host, which alone
owns zero or one replaceable Old Pine Session. Cold start shows Menu, not hidden gameplay.

## Incomplete work

- Combat Phase 5B4 and later full combat parity;
- Cave expansion, Keep, Lake/serpent, and the remaining ES2 world/content;
- Phase 10C1 final PR/CI/merge/post-merge integration;
- virtual/touch controls, responsive mobile HUD, safe areas/notches, Android Back behavior,
  orientation and mobile lifecycle policy;
- final UI, art, animation, VFX, audio, balance, accessibility, and localization;
- permanent Android/iOS signing, store metadata, installer/package policy, Steam/Play/App Store/
  TestFlight upload, and final release gates.

The Phase 10A pipeline sends the same sanitized game project to Windows, Android, and iOS targets.
Windows and Android Release exports are locally proven. GitHub Actions workflow run `33350605585`
also proved `Godot Verify`, Windows Release, Android Release, and the unsigned iOS Xcode compile on
the same commit, with all three platform artifact uploads succeeding. None of this means the current
desktop-oriented gameplay UX is comfortable or complete on phones/tablets.

## Release and licensing boundary

Phase 10A Windows output is unsigned. Android uses a per-build ephemeral QA key and is not a Play
Store release. iOS is an unsigned Xcode compile validation and is not an IPA, App Store, or TestFlight
build. The provisional mobile identifier is `com.example.easternstoriesgodot`; it is not a domain-
ownership claim and must be replaced before store signing.

The repository has no root project license. See `LICENSE_PROVENANCE.md` for the unresolved ES2
evidence and verified third-party records.
